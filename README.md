# Artificial Intelligence Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI projects. Here, I explore a variety of **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques applied across different domains. These projects reflect my hands-on experience building AI systems to tackle real-world problems in areas like reinforcement learning, NLP, and computer vision.

## Techniques Used

- **Reinforcement Learning**: 
  - Applied to train agents that learn through interaction with environments. Techniques like **Q-Learning** and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** were employed for training agents in complex game scenarios.
  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
  - Built CNN architectures for image classification tasks, achieving high accuracy in multi-class problems such as distinguishing between bird species and detecting objects.

- **Text Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Implemented sentiment classification using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, leveraging word embeddings and sequence models to predict positive or negative sentiment in movie reviews.

- **Image Segmentation and Inpainting**:
  - Employed **HRNet** for precise image segmentation, combined with **Stable Diffusion** models for object inpainting, enabling object removal and replacement in images.

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Atari RL Agents**
   - **Description**: 
     This project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to train agents for Atari games like PONG and VIDEOPINBALL. Using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, the agents were trained to play these games with near-human proficiency, optimizing their decision-making over time.
   - **Technologies**: TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

### 2. **Bird and Squirrel Classification**
   - **Description**: 
     Built a deep learning model to classify over 200 bird species using CNNs. The project also involved creating a binary classifier to distinguish between birds and squirrels, achieving 98% accuracy.
   - **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### 3. **Blackjack with Q-Learning**
   - **Description**: 
     A reinforcement learning agent trained to play Blackjack using Q-learning. The agent was able to learn optimal strategies through exploration and exploitation, improving its gameplay performance over multiple training iterations.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Q-Learning, Reinforcement Learning

### 4. **IMDB Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Description**: 
     Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The model used word embeddings and pooling techniques for text classification, achieving an 83.16% accuracy.
   - **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 5. **Image Segmentation and Inpainting**
   - **Description**: 
     This project focuses on removing, replacing, and segmenting objects (birds) in images using deep learning techniques. HRNet was employed for segmentation, and Stable Diffusion models were used to inpaint missing objects or replace them with squirrels.
   - **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Stable Diffusion, HRNet
